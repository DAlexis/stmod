# stmod
Streamer modelling software. At early stage of development.

Finite elements computations based in [Deal.II](https://github.com/dealii/dealii) framework.


## Now done
Mesh generation over gmsh. Realistic geometry.
Poisson equation solver on axially symmetric geometry.


## Active tasks
### Hi priority

- [X] Diffusion problem works with axial symmetry

- [ ] Grid adaptive refine in dynamic

- [ ] Deal.ii RK45 iterator support


### Low priority

- [x] Manifold ids for grid near the needle

- [ ] Manifold ids for boundary -- ask Fedor

- [x] Laplacian output test
