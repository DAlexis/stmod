# stmod
Streamer modelling software. At early stage of development.

Finite elements computations based in [Deal.II](https://github.com/dealii/dealii) framework.


## Now done
Mesh generation over gmsh. Realistic geometry.
Poisson equation solver on axially symmetric geometry.


## Active tasks
[X] Solution-like fields sampling with gradients and laplacians
[x] Vector field output class from FESampler
[ ] Scalar field output class
[ ] Manifold ids for grid near the needle
[ ] Laplacian output test
[ ] Solution-like vector interpolation for refine
[ ] Electrons emission possibility
